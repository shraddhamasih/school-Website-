            <p>We believe in creating an education system where values are more important than academic score cards, compassion than competence, cooperation than competition, in order to nurture generations of individuals and to provide them with a holistic experience that synergizes the growth of mind, body and spirit.Our mission is not to simply disseminate knowledge to the students, but also to inculcate in them â€“ discipline, integrity and a humanitarian spirit with a positive attitude, to imbibe social and moral values, in order to develop a sense of national identity as well as global citizenship.Our philosophy, 'Every student can learn, just not on the same day, or the same way', rests on the principle that every student has different personality and interest. And we believe that every student is here to learn. They all might not learn the very same day or in the same way, but eventually they will learn and grow some or the other day.</p>
